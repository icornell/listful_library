# Finals Script

Title: Listful App Showcase

**Taylor:** "Hi everyone, our group consists of myself (Taylor), Luna, Jeremy and India. We created a library app called "Listful" for our final project, and we can't wait to show you more. But first, a quick introduction to our team. Personally, before Lighthouse Labs I have worked in sales at two local software companies and also a FAANG company. My experience there has ignited my curisoity with regards to software development and ultimately lead to my time here at Lighthouse Labs.

**Taylor:** We were inspired to take on this project because we are all avid readers and have used some sort of book app in the past and we wanted to create an app that resonates with the passion of every book lover. The main idea of our app is to keep track of the books you own as well as to explore and create lists of books you want to own one day.

**Jeremy:** We decided as a team to build Listful using a tech stack of React, Javascript, PostgresSQL, Node and Express. We also are getting information on a collection of books through the Google Books API.

**Luna:** " Thanks Jeremy, okay, I'm excited to guide you through our library app today. I'll be controlling the screen, and we have Taylor here, who'll be discussing more details about our fantastic features. So, without further ado, let's dive in!"

**Taylor:** "Thanks Luna! First up, we've made it super easy for you to login to your own profile. From here you can create and manage your very own favorites list. Watch as we effortlessly add a book to our favorites right here."

**Taylor:** "In addition to the favorites list, we've streamlined the book-browsing process. You can now explore our extensive collection with ease. Let me show you how straightforward it is to find the perfect book for your taste."

**Taylor:** Moving on from browsing and adding books to your list, have you ever been curious about what other readers think of a book? Listful has got you covered! You can view the average rating for each book, giving you insights into popular picks. It's a great way to discover new reads and connect with the reading community. Let take a look at how we can access this valuable feature."

**India:** Now, let's talk about the immersive experience of our app. When you click on a book, a detailed modal window pops up, providing you with more information than ever before. You can explore the book cover, read a summary, check out the author details, and more. It's like having a personal library assistant! Let me show you how this feature enhances your interaction with each book."

**Taylor:** "Wow, that modal looks great, India! To wrap it up, our library app is designed for personalization, effortless browsing, community insights, and a rich book-viewing experience. We're thrilled to bring you this seamless and enjoyable way to connect with your favorite reads. Thank you for your time, and we're here to answer any questions you may have!"
