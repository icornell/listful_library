# Finals Script

Title: Listful App Showcase

**Taylor:** Hi everyone! I'm Taylor, part of our dynamic team alongside Luna, Jeremy, and India. Together, we crafted a game-changing library app called 'Listful' for our final project, and today, we're thrilled to dive into the exciting features. But before that, let's quickly introduce ourselves. Before my time at Lighthouse Labs, I navigated the world of sales in both local software companies and even a FAANG giant. These experiences fueled my curiosity for software development, leading me here.

**India:** 15-20 second Introduction

**Taylor:** Our collective love for books and previous experiences with various book apps sparked the inspiration for Listful. We set out to create an app that resonates with the passion of every book lover. The core idea behind Listful is to keep track of the books you own and to curate lists of books you aspire to have one day.

**Jeremy:** As a team we decided to build Listful using a powerful tech stack of React, Javascript, PostgresSQL, Node and Express. We're also integrating information from a vast collection of books through the Google Books API.

**Luna:** "Thanks, Jeremy! Now, let's delve into the heart of our presentation. I'm excited to guide you through Listful, and I'll be controlling the screen. Taylor, take it away with the fantastic features!"

You can view the average rating for each book, gaining insights into popular picks. It's a fantastic way to discover new reads and connect with the reading community. Let's take a look at how we can access this valuable feature."

You can explore the book cover, read a summary, check out the author details, and more. It's like having a personal library assistant! Let me show you how this feature enhances your interaction with each book."
