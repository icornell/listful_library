<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Listful allows users to keep track of their library - on the go! Never again come home with a new book only to discover you already own it. Keep track of what volumes you own and which ones you are still looking to buy. Make libraries of books you love, track what you own, and make notes of your thoughts.

Ways to use Listful:
* Keep track of what books you own
* Track your wishlist
* Make your own 'libraries'
* Make notes of your thoughts on books you've read
* Keep track of your friends libraries too! (Now it's possible to buy gifts for the book lovers in your life!) :smile:

Thank you for checking out our final project!

### Built With
